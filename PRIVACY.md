## Telementry
Screenbox only collects exception details such as exception messages and stack traces. When a crash or an error occurs, an anonymized incident report is sent to our error reporting service [Visual Studio App Center](https://appcenter.ms/). This report does not contain any personally identifiable information. However, it does include your machine model name, Windows version, and Windows language. Screenbox does not generate running logs or usage behaviors and, therefore, will never track your activities while using the app.

Telementry is used to assess Screenbox's adaptation and identify programming issues, guiding the development process. This data is not used for marketing or sales. This data is not sent to any third party.

Source code of the telementry service is public and can be viewed from the project's repository.
