## Translation

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/screenbox/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/screenbox)

Help translate the app to your language on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/screenbox)! Crowdin offers an intuitive UX for you to get started and is the recommended tool for localization. Translations are automatically synced to GitHub and published in the next minor update.

You can also translate the app locally without Crowdin. The project source language is English, United States. All localizable source files are in the `Screenbox\Strings\en-US` directory. Localizable file types are `.resw` and `.md`. It is recommended that you use [ResX Resource Manager](https://github.com/dotnet/ResXResourceManager) for easier `.resw` translation.

Make sure you have your translations in the appropriate folder under the `Screenbox\Strings` directory. We use a [IETF language tag](https://www.venea.net/web/culture_code) to name the folder that contains resources for that language (e.g. `fr-FR` for French (France), `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain)). Files in these folders are translated copies of the original resource files in `Screenbox\Strings\en-US`.

A typical workflow for translating resources:

1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Create a folder for your language under `Screenbox\Strings` if there isn't one already.
1. Copy over any missing files from the `en-US` folder. 
1. Translate the `.resw` and `.md` files in the directory.
1. Once you're done, commit your changes, push to GitHub, and make a pull request.
